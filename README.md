## Puzzles and Conquest Mobile Game

The once glorious Saurland was fallen under the Undead Army's attack.
Darkness and flames follow their path of carnage; their reign of terror devoured all hope.
The dead were brought back to life, and the horrific legion expands.
The whole continent is on the brink of destruction.
Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and all the other races laid aside their differences to form an alliance for their survival.
Yet, they await an extraordinary leader to take charge against the army of evil.
Lead them with your capable hands and strategic mind!

### Vailant Conquest

Valiant Conquest is a KvK event ocurring every two weeks.  **All troops killed by other Kingdoms during the event are automatically healed once the event ends.**  However, attacks from other players in the same kingdom or Hell's Fortress casualties go into the normal infirmary.
